                            <h2>TEA PRODUCTION</h2>
                            
                            <p>Sri Lanka tea production for the month of December 2022 totalled 19.50 million Kgs, showing a decrease of 1.02 million Kgs vis-à-vis 20.52 million Kgs of December 2021. All elevations have shown a decline over the corresponding month of 2021.

                                It would be relevant to note in comparing the December 2020 production figure of 28.66 million Kgs, December 2022 shows a significant decrease of 9.16 million Kgs.
                                
                                January-December 2022 cumulative production totalled 251.50 million Kgs, recording a significant decline of 47.99 million Kgs vis-à-vis 299.49 million Kgs of January-December 2021. On a cumulative basis, all elevations have shown substantial decline over the corresponding period of 2021. 
                                
                                Interestingly, compared to 278.85 million Kgs of January-December 2020, cumulative production of 2022 shows a decrease of 27.35 million Kgs. On a cumulative basis, all elevations have shown a decline over the corresponding period of 2020.</p>

                            <p>The commencement of the year 2023 (1st Quarter) would perhaps be much-awaited by all stake-holders, particularly from a production point of view with the revoking of the ban imposed on the usage of chemical fertilizer on tea plantations.

                                The expectance of a higher crop intake alongside an improved Western Quality Season compared with previous years are certain elements that would undoubtedly provide the forthcoming year a positive note to commence upon.
                                
                                We analyse below the supply and demand situation that exists and project likely market scenarios taking into consideration recent developments in importer countries.
