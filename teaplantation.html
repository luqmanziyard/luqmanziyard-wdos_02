                        <h2>Central Province</h2>
                        <p>Tea grown in this region comes from Nuwara Eliya and Kandy. In Nuwara Eliya tea is grown at an elevation of 6,200ft above sea level and has rare and refined qualities that differs from the low-grown teas. As a result of the higher altitudes and low-temperatures, Nuwara Eliya produces slow-grown bushes with rather small leaves which takes on an orange hue after withering. The infused tea leaves take on a greenish-yellow and has a pale liquor compared to other Ceylon Teas.

                            Kandy is famous for mid-grown teas and is also responsible for producing flavorsome teas. Kandy produces a variety of strengths and styles, and it all depends on the elevation of which the tea is grown at, tea grown at a lower elevation produces a rather large leaf and has a strong flavor when infused and tea grown at a higher elevation produces a smaller leaf and has a mild and delicate flavor to it. The best tea is produced in the first quarter of the year when the cool and dry weather sets in. Teas hailing from Kandy produce bright infusions with coppery tones, and also has fair amounts of strength and body.</p>

                        <p>Tea grown in this region has a little variation to it than of the teas grown in southern district, this is a result of the wider range of altitude at which it is grown and the varied climatic conditions. They too produce a fast-growing bush with long leaves that are rather black when withered and very well suited for rolling. The liquor too is similar to that of the teas from southern district, a dark-yellow brown with a hint of red and during the dry season a little bit lighter in shade. The aroma though is completely different with a hint of sweet caramel and not quite as strong as southern teas and the flavor of the teas are somewhat stronger.</p>
