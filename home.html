                            <p>James Taylor arrived in Ceylon in 1852, settling down at the Loolecondera Estate, Galaha. He begins a 19-acre tea plantation on the Loolecondera Estate in 1867, laying the foundation for what would become Sri Lanka’s largest export industry for over a century. In 1872, a fully equipped tea factory began operating on the Loolecondera Estate. In 1873, Ceylon Tea made its international debut when twenty-three pounds of tea produced by James Taylor reached London.</p>

                        <h2>Regions Of Tea Cultivation</h2>
                        
                        <p>Ceylon tea has a distinctive taste and it has qualities unique to itself, likewise the tea produced in each region in Sri Lanka has its unique characteristics, the taste and quality of tea differs from region to region. This is the result of the different climates and elevations present in the regions.
                            Kandy is famous for mid-grown teas and is also responsible for producing flavorsome teas. Kandy produces a variety of strengths and styles, and it all depends on the elevation of which the tea is grown at, tea grown at a lower elevation produces a rather large leaf and has a strong flavor when infused and tea grown at a higher elevation produces a smaller leaf and has a mild and delicate flavor to it.
                            The tea grown in the Uva region has a distinctive flavor and are mainly used in blends. 
                            Best known as low-grown teas, the tea estates of this region lies within an elevation of 2000ft above sea level. The soil and the low elevation of the region contributes to the rapid growth of the tea bush and produces a long beautiful leaf that turns intensely black on withering and is ideal for ‘rolling’.
